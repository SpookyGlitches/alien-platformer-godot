# The Lost Alien 
Control the player by the arrow keys and spacebar as it continually runs forward. Along  the way, you have to collect key/s that will help you pass through a door to proceed to a higher level while avoiding various obstacles. The game has seven different levels, and as it  progresses, the intensity changes as the game advances along with the environment and  enemyâ€™s appearance. The goal of the game is to finish all levels with the shortest possible time.

This project is a requirement for a course. The game is not optimized and not fun. [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) engine was picked because it's FOSS and easy to pick up as they say.
